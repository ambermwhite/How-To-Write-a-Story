            <h2>Characters</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <p>Characters are one of the most important elements in a story. Without characters how can there be a story? It is also important to make the main character(s) likable and relatable. You wouldn't want to read a story where the central character got everything they wanted and nothing ever went wrong. That wouldn't be very fun to read because the character is spoiled and if nothing ever went wrong, what would the story be about?
            </p>
            <p>The main character(s) and even some suporting characters are supposed to have some sort of development throughout the story. A good character has some sort of goal in mind and some sort of obstacle that the character has to get past to reach their goal. All good characters also have to face some type of conflict, be it internal or external. The conflics the character faces and the obsticals they have to get through all help change the character and allow the character to learn and develop.

            <h2>Types of Characters</h2>
            <p>There are several types of characters in a story.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                <h4>Protagonist:</h4>
                    <p>The protagonist is the main character in the story. The story and plot usually revolve around this characters and their actions. When writing a story it is important to spend a good amount of time developing the character and makeing the chaacter memorable and likeable. A good protagonist has achievable goals and challenges that they have to beat to reach their goals.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                <h4>Antagonist:</h4>
                    <p>The antagonist is usually the villan in the story, the one who opposes the protagonist. Just like your protagonist, it is important to spend time developing this character because they are also a main character in the story. They should also have goals and challenges they have to get past, usually opposite of the protagonist.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                <h4>Minor Characters:</h4>
                    <p>Minor characters are necessary for a story. They are there to intereact with the main characters and help the story progress. Even though they are necessary, they don't need a lot of development. You don't have to spend much time creating a complex personality for them, especially if they are not related to the plot.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                <h4>Static Characters:</h4>
                    <p> A static character, also known as a flat character, plays a minor roll in the story and is just there to support the protagonist and/or antagonist. They don't change much as the story progresses and you don't need to spend much time developing these characters.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                <h4>Dynamic Characters:</h4>
                    <p>A dynamic character, also known as a round character, is usally the main characters of the story. These characters will grow and change with the story as they face more challenges and conflics. You will want to spend time developing these characters.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Characterization</h2>
            <p> This is how you, the writer, present the characters to the readers. Different aspects such as <strong>actions, appearance, dialogue, thoughts, feelings,</strong> and <strong>relationships</strong> reveal the character's personality. Asking questions about your character can help you develop their unique personality.
            </p>
            <p>You can describe your character directly or indirectly, it is up to you. Most writers don't directly tell their reader what the character is like, they let the characters actions and thoughts speak for them.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Character Profile</h2>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wQcQ-As2BU0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen class="video"></iframe>
            <p>
                Another tool that can hlep you develop your character(s) is a character profile. Your character needs to be unique, interesting, realistic, and appealing to the reader. By creating a character profile you can get a good visual of your character and who they are.
            </p>
            <p>
                In your character profile, you can include the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Name</li>
                <li>Age</li>
                <li>Gender</li>
                <li>Education</li>
                <li>Job</li>
                <li>Interests</li>
                <li>Likes/Dislikes</li>
                <li>Important Traits</li>
                <li>Personality</li>
                <li>Clothing Style</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
        <h2>Dialogue</h2>
            <p>A lot the reader learns about the character is through what the character says. The character's personality is also expressed through how he or she speaks. Dialogue should help move the story forward and help the character in reaching their goal. </p>
            <p>Another important thing about dialogue is not to use the word 'said' over and over. It becomes a bit to repetative... Instead use the following chart to find a better word than said.</p>
           <table style="width: 100%">
