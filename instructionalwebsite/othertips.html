        <h2>Practice</h2>
            <p>Like all things, you get get better at it unless you practice. The phrase, "Practice makes Perfect," isn't overused for no reason. Perfection doesn't happen over night with any skill, including writing.It is important to write everyday. Excuses will not help you get better. You obviously don't have to write an entire book right away, start small. Find writing prompts online and write a short story. Writing prompts can inspire you and they allow you to be as creative as you want.</p>
            <p>Don't worry about being a good writer immedietly. That kind of thinking will hold you back, just write. Don't look a writing for fame or to get published, just write what you want to write. If it turns out really good then you can try to get it published.</p>

        <h2>Write in One Sitting</h2>
            <p>If you do have a story idea in mind, great! A good idea would be to start writing as much as you can in one sitting. Get all of your ideas out on paper. Don't worry about plotting or developing characters right away, just get it on paper. You need something to refer to and and idea to start with before publishing a final copy. If you are writing a short story, try to write it in one stitting. If you are trying to write a novel, try to write it in three months. The point in this is to get as much of it on paper as possibe. You can go back and fix mistakes and change things later, all you need is a starting point.</p>

        <h2>Editing</h2>
            <p>A lot of writers write three drafts or more when writing a story:</p>
            <p><strong style="text-decoration: underline">The First Draft</strong>, often called the "vomit draft," is like I mentioned above. It is used to get your idea on paper and see what you want your story to be about. It is like a rough sketch in a drawing. Its probably going to be bad, but that's why you you create another draft.</p>
            <p><strong style="text-decoration: underline">The Second Draft</strong> is for major changes such as clarifiying or changing the plot and developing your characters more. Many do try to edit and refine the second draft but that can be a waste of time. Just getting the major changes out of the way is important.</p>
            <p><strong style="text-decoration: underline">The Third Draft</strong> is for polishing. Editing sentences and spell checking is the main goal here. It is also for fininalizing the plot and characters. This pretty much is where you round out your story.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Writer's Block</h2>
            <p>Every writer experiences this at some point. You lose creativiy and you just can't seem to write worth it. A few different things can cause writer's block. One, it just might not be the right time. You might feel more creative later, just not right now. Two, fear might be the problem. The fear of your story not being good enough or just putting your story out there for people to see might be what's holding you back. Finally, perfectionism can be what's causing writer's block. If you want everything to be <em>absolutely perfect</em> the first time you write it then you'll loose inspiration quickly. Or you try to create every detail in your head before writing, but you never get a chance to actually write it.</p>
            <p>One of the best ways to defeat writiers block is to just write. You don't have to write good, just write. Like I mentioned in "Practice," writing prompts can also help. It doesn't need to be a good story, it's just something to help you feel creative and be able to write.</p>
            <p>If that doesn't work then just find ways to inspire your creativity. Eliminat distractions, go for a walk, excersise, listen to music, brainstorm, etc. Reading and becoming inspired by other works could also be very helpful.</p>
            <p><strong><em>DO NOT</em></strong> refuse to write unil you feel inspired because then you will never overcome writer's block. Don't procrastinate or make excuses, the best way to get over it is to write.</p>
