                <h2>Plot</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <p>There is no such thing as a story without a plot. The plot drives the story forward and keeps your readers interested. The plot is the events in the story and the order those event's happen. A story's plot also has to be interesting. If it is all happiness and easy solutions then there really isn't much to push the story or keep the reader interested. It's kind of like getting from point A to point B. The protagonist has a goal (A) and they have to acheive that goal (B). Most of the story is the obstacles that the protagonist(s) go through to reach point B.</p>

        <h2>Ways to Develop a Great Plot</h2>
            <p>A good way to start developing your plot is to map it out. Look at it as a whole and not just individul chapters. Make a timeline of important events and have a brief descripion of each. Even if you change it when you actually start writing, at least you have an idea of what will happen.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <p>Most plots follow the same structure:</p>

        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <p>Just a short description for each section of the diagram can help you as you write. You could also write a quick first draft of your story where you are writing as you think of it. Then after you finish your first draft you can go back and flesh it out a bit more and add more detail. </p>
            <p>A final tip to help you develop the plot is to storyboard your story. Use index cards and write down each important scene on the card. Include things like: <br>- Where the scene is taking place?<br>- Who is in the scene?<br>- What is happening in the scene?<br>- Why is it important to the overall story?</p>

            <h2> Conflicts </h2>
            <p>Conflict is very important when it comes to writing a story.</p>

            <h3>Man vs. Self</h3>
